.. _tornado-common-collector:

Collector Common
````````````````

The *tornado_collector_common* crate contains the Trait definitions for
the Collectors. A *Collector* is an event data source. It receives
information from one or more unstructured sources (e.g. emails or log
files), produces structured Events, and sends them to the Tornado
engine.


.. _tornado-json-collectors:

JSON Collectors
```````````````

These are Collectors that receive an input in JSON and unmarshall it
into an internal Event struct.

There are currently two available implementations:

1. The *JsonEventCollector*
2. The *JsonPayloadCollector*

.. _tornado-jsonevent-collector:

JsonEventCollector
++++++++++++++++++

The *JsonEventCollector* expects to receive a valid JSON representation
of a Tornado Event as input. It is used internally by Tornado to
unmarshall Events received, for example, from a TCP or UDS socket.

The JSON input format should respect the Event structure, for example:

.. code:: json

   {
     "type": "email",
     "created_ms": 1554130814854,
     "payload":{
       "subject": "Email subject",
       "body": "Email body",
       "other": {
         "some_text": "some text",
         "a_bool": true,
         "a_number": 123456.789,
         "something_else": {}
       }
     }
   }

.. _tornado-jsonpayload-collector:

JsonPayloadCollector
++++++++++++++++++++

The *JsonPayloadCollector* receives any valid JSON object and creates a
Tornado Event whose payload is that input. For example, the following
input:

.. code:: json

   {
     "@timestamp": "2018-11-01T23:59:59+01:00",
     "host": "neteye01",
     "hostgroups": [
       "windows",
       "database",
       "rome"
     ],
     "icinga_customfields": {
       "snmpcommunity": "secret",
       "os": "windows"
     },
     "severity": "DEBUG",
     "facility": "daemon",
     "syslog-tag": "nfcapd[20747]:",
     "source": "nfcapd",
     "message": " Process_v9: Found options flowset: template 259"
   }

will generate this Event:

.. code:: json

   {
     "type": "event_type_from_config",
     "created_ms": 1554130814854,
     "payload": {
       "@timestamp": "2018-11-01T23:59:59+01:00",
       "host": "neteye01",
       "hostgroups": [
         "windows",
         "database",
         "rome"
       ],
       "icinga_customfields": {
         "snmpcommunity": "secret",
         "os": "windows"
       },
       "severity": "DEBUG",
       "facility": "daemon",
       "syslog-tag": "nfcapd[20747]:",
       "source": "nfcapd",
       "message": " Process_v9: Found options flowset: template 259"
     }
   }

The Event "type" property must be specified when the collector is
instantiated.

.. _tornado-jmespath-collector:

JMESPath Collector
``````````````````

This is a Collector that receives an input in JSON format and allows the
creation of Events using the `JMESPath JSON query
language <http://jmespath.org/>`__.

.. _tornado-email-collector:

Email Collector
```````````````

The *Email Collector* receives a `MIME email
message <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME>`__ as input, parses it, and
produces a Tornado Event.

How It Works
++++++++++++

When the *Email Collector* receives a valid `MIME email
message <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME>`__ as input, it parses it
and produces a Tornado Event with the extracted data.

For example, given the following input::

   Subject: This is a test email
   Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=foobar
   Date: Sun, 02 Oct 2016 07:06:22 -0700 (PDT)

   --foobar
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

   This is the plaintext version, in utf-8. Proof by Euro: =E2=82=AC
   --foobar
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

   PGh0bWw+PGJvZHk+VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgPGI+SFRNTDwvYj4gdmVyc2lvbiwgaW4g 
   dXMtYXNjaWkuIFByb29mIGJ5IEV1cm86ICZldXJvOzwvYm9keT48L2h0bWw+Cg== 
   --foobar--

it will generate this Event:

.. code:: json

   {
     "type": "email",
     "created_ms": 1554130814854,
     "payload": {
       "date": 1475417182,
       "subject": "This is a test email",
       "to": "",
       "from": "",
       "cc": "",
       "body": "This is the plaintext version, in utf-8. Proof by Euro: â‚¬",
       "attachments": []
     }
   }

If there are attachments, then attachments that are text files will be
in plain text, otherwise they will be encoded in base64.

For example, passing this email with attachments:

.. code:: mime

   From: "Francesco" <francesco@example.com>
   Subject: Test for Mail collector - with attachments
   To: "Benjamin" <benjamin@example.com>,
    francesco <francesco@example.com>
   Cc: thomas@example.com, francesco@example.com
   Date: Sun, 02 Oct 2016 07:06:22 -0700 (PDT)
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: multipart/mixed;
    boundary="------------E5401F4DD68F2F7A872C2A83"
   Content-Language: en-US

   This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
   --------------E5401F4DD68F2F7A872C2A83
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

   --------------E5401F4DD68F2F7A872C2A83--

will generate this Event:

.. code:: json

   {
     "type": "email",
     "created_ms": 1554130814854,
     "payload": {
       "date": 1475417182,
       "subject": "Test for Mail collector - with attachments",
       "to": "\"Benjamin\" <benjamin@example.com>, francesco <francesco@example.com>",
       "from": "\"Francesco\" <francesco@example.com>",
       "cc": "thomas@example.com, francesco@example.com",
       "body": "<html>Test for Mail collector with attachments</html>",
       "attachments": [
         {
           "filename": "sample.pdf",
           "mime_type": "application/pdf",
           "encoding": "base64",
           "content": "JVBERi0xLjMNCiXi48/TDQoNCjEgMCBvYmoNCjw8DQovVHlwZSAvQ2F0YWxvZw0KT0YNCg=="
         },
         {
           "filename": "sample.txt",
           "mime_type": "text/plain",
           "encoding": "plaintext",
           "content": "txt file context for email collector\n1234567890987654321\n"
         }
       ]
     }
   }

Within the Tornado Event, the *filename* and *mime_type* properties of
each attachment are the values extracted from the incoming email.

Instead, the *encoding* property refers to how the *content* is encoded
in the Event itself. It can be one of two types:

-  **plaintext**: The content is included in plain text
-  **base64**: The content is encoded in base64

Particular cases
++++++++++++++++

The email collector follows these rules to generate the Tornado Event:

-  If more than one body is present in the email or its subparts, the
   first valid body found is used, while the others will be ignored
-  Content Dispositions different from *Inline* and *Attachment* are
   ignored
-  Content Dispositions of type *Inline* are processed only if the
   content type is *text/\**
-  The email subparts are not scanned recursively, thus only the
   subparts at the root level are evaluated

.. _tornado-email-collector-exec:

Tornado Email Collector (Executable)
````````````````````````````````````

The *Email Collector Executable* binary is an executable that generates
Tornado Events from `MIME <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME>`__ email
inputs.

How It Works
++++++++++++

The Email Collector Executable is built on
`actix <https://github.com/actix/actix>`__.

On startup, it creates a `UDS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket>`__ socket where qit
listens for incoming email messages. Each email published on the
socket is processed by the embedded :ref:`tornado-email-collector` to
produce Tornado Events which are, finally, forwarded to the Tornado
Engine's TCP address.

The UDS socket is created with the same user and group as the
tornado_email_collector process, with permissions set to **770** (read,
write and execute for both the user and the group).

Each client that needs to write an email message to the socket should
close the connection as soon as it completes its action. In fact, the
Email Collector Executable will not even start processing that email
until it receives an `EOF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file>`__
signal. Only one email per connection is allowed.

.. rubric:: Procmail Example

This client behavior can be obtained, for instance, by using
`procmail <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procmail>`__ with the following
configuration::

   ## .procmailrc file
   MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail                 # You should make sure this exists
   LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/procmail.log

   # This is where we ask procmail to write to our UDS socket.
   SHELL=/bin/sh
   :0
   | /usr/bin/socat - /var/run/tornado_email_collector/email.sock 2>&1

A precondition for procmail to work is that the mail server in use must
be properly configured to notify procmail whenever it receives new
email.

For additional information about how incoming email is processed and
the structure of the generated Event, check the documentation specific
to the embedded :ref:`tornado-email-collector`.

Note that the Email Collector will support any email client that works
with the MIME format and UDS sockets.

.. _tornado-rsyslog-collector-exec:

Tornado Rsyslog Collector (executable)
``````````````````````````````````````

The rsyslog Collector binary is an executable that generates Tornado
Events from rsyslog inputs.

How It Works
++++++++++++

This Collector is meant to be integrated with rsyslogâ€™s own logging
through the `omprog
module <https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omprog.html>`__.
Consequently, it is never started manually, but instead will be started,
and managed, directly by rsyslog itself.

Here is an example rsyslog configuration template that pipes logs to the
rsyslog-collector (the parameters are explained below)::

   module(load="omprog")

   action(type="omprog"
          binary="/path/to/tornado_rsyslog_collector --some-collector-options")

An example of a fully instantiated startup setup is::

   module(load="omprog")

   action(type="omprog"
          binary="/path/to/rsyslog_collector --config-dir=/tornado-rsyslog-collector/config --tornado-event-socket-ip=tornado_server_ip --tornado-event-socket-port=4747")

..   <!-- This part may only be necessary for non-expert users. Hide until later? -->

Note that all parameters for the *binary* option must be on the same
line. You will need to place this configuration in a file in your
rsyslog directory, for instance::

   /etc/rsyslog.d/tornado.conf

In this example the collector will:

-  Reads the configuration from the */tornado-rsyslog-collector/config*
   directory
-  Write outgoing Events to the TCP socket at tornado_server_ip:4747

The Collector will need to be run in parallel with the Tornado engine
before any events will be processed, for example::

   /opt/tornado/bin/tornado --tornado-event-socket-ip=tornado_server_ip

Under this configuration, rsyslog is in charge of starting the collector
when needed and piping the incoming logs to it. As the last stage, the
Tornado Events generated by the collector are forwarded to the Tornado
Engine's TCP socket.

This integration strategy is the best option for supporting high
performance given massive amounts of log data.

Because the collector expects the input to be in JSON format, **rsyslog
should be pre-configured** to properly pipe its inputs in this form.

.. _tornado-webhook-collector-exec:

Tornado Webhook Collector (executable)
``````````````````````````````````````

The Webhook Collector is a standalone HTTP server that listens for REST
calls from a generic webhook, generates Tornado Events from the webhook
JSON body, and sends them to the Tornado Engine.

How It Works
++++++++++++

The webhook collector executable is an HTTP server built on
`actix-web <https://github.com/actix/actix-web>`__.

On startup, it creates a dedicated REST endpoint for each configured
webhook. Calls received by an endpoint are processed by the embedded
:ref:`tornado-jmespath-collector` that uses them to produce Tornado Events. In
the final step, the Events are forwarded to the Tornado Engine through
the configured connection type.

For each webhook, you must provide three values in order to successfully
create an endpoint:

-  *id*: The webhook identifier. This will determine the path of the
   endpoint; it must be unique per webhook.
-  *token*: A security token that the webhook issuer has to include in
   the URL as part of the query string (see the example at the bottom of
   this page for details). If the token provided by the issuer is
   missing or does not match the one owned by the collector, then the
   call will be rejected and an HTTP 401 code (UNAUTHORIZED) will be
   returned.
-  *collector_config*: The transformation logic that converts a webhook
   JSON object into a Tornado Event. It consists of a JMESPath collector
   configuration as described in its :ref:`specific
   documentation <tornado-jmespath-collector>`.

.. _tornado-nats-json-collector-exec:

Tornado Nats JSON Collector (executable)
````````````````````````````````````````

The Nats JSON Collector is a standalone collector that listens for JSON
messages on Nats topics, generates Tornado Events, and sends them to the
Tornado Engine.

How It Works
++++++++++++

The Nats JSON collector executable is built on
`actix <https://github.com/actix/actix>`__.

On startup, it connects to a set of topics on a Nats server. Calls
received are then processed by the embedded :ref:`jmespath collector
<tornado-jmespath-collector>` that uses them to produce Tornado Events. In the
final step, the Events are forwarded to the Tornado Engine through the
configured connection type.

For each topic, you must provide two values in order to successfully
configure them:

-  *nats_topics*: A list of Nats topics to which the collector will
   subscribe.
-  *collector_config*: (Optional) The transformation logic that
   converts a JSON object received from Nats into a Tornado Event. It
   consists of a JMESPath collector configuration as described in its
   :ref:`specific documentation <tornado-jmespath-collector>`.


.. _tornado-icinga-collector-exec:

Tornado Icinga2 Collector (executable)
``````````````````````````````````````

The Icinga2 Collector subscribes to the `Icinga2 API event
streams <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams>`__,
generates Tornado Events from the Icinga2 Events, and publishes them on
the Tornado Engine TCP address.

How It Works
++++++++++++

The Icinga2 collector executable is built on
`actix <https://github.com/actix/actix>`__.

On startup, it connects to an existing `Icinga2 Server API
<https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/>`__ and
subscribes to user defined `Event Streams
<https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams>`__.
Each Icinga2 Event published on the stream, is processed by the
embedded :ref:`jmespath collector <tornado-jmespath-collector>` that uses them
to produce Tornado Events which are, finally, forwarded to the Tornado
Engine's TCP address.

More than one stream subscription can be defined. For each stream, you
must provide two values in order to successfully create a subscription:

-  *stream*: the stream configuration composed of:

   -  *types*: An array of `Icinga2 Event
      types <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-stream-types>`__;
   -  *queue*: A unique queue name used by Icinga2 to identify the
      stream;
   -  *filter*: An optional Event Stream filter. Additional information
      about the filter can be found in the `official
      documentation <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-stream-filter>`__.

-  *collector_config*: The transformation logic that converts an Icinga2
   Event into a Tornado Event. It consists of a JMESPath collector
   configuration as described in its :ref:`specific
   documentation <tornado-jmespath-collector>`.

.. note:: Based on the `Icinga2 Event Streams documentation
   <https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#event-streams>`__,
   multiple HTTP clients can use the same queue name as long as they
   use the same event types and filter.

.. _tornado-snmptrap-collector:

SNMP Trap Daemon Collectors
```````````````````````````

The \_snmptrapd_collector_s of this package are embedded Perl trap
handlers for Net-SNMP's snmptrapd. When registered as a subroutine in
the Net-SNMP snmptrapd process, they receives snmptrap-specific inputs,
transforms them into Tornado Events, and forwards them to the Tornado
Engine.

There are two collector implementations, the first one sends Events
directly to the Tornado TCP socket and the second one forwards them to a
NATS server.

The implementations rely on the Perl NetSNMP::TrapReceiver package. You
can refer to `its
documentation <https://metacpan.org/pod/NetSNMP::TrapReceiver>`__ for
generic configuration examples and usage advice.

How They Work
+++++++++++++

The \_snmptrapd_collector_s receive snmptrapd messages, parse them,
generate Tornado Events and, finally, sends them to Tornado using their
specific communication channel.

The received messages are kept in an in-memory non-persistent buffer
that makes the application resilient to crashes or temporary
unavailability of the communication channel. When the connection to the
channel is restored, all messages in the buffer will be sent. When the
buffer is full, the collectors will start discarding old messages. The
buffer max size is set to ``10000`` messages.

Consider a snmptrapd message that contains the following information::

   PDU INFO:
     version                        1
     errorstatus                    0
     community                      public
     receivedfrom                   UDP: [127.0.1.1]:41543->[127.0.2.2]:162
     transactionid                  1
     errorindex                     0
     messageid                      0
     requestid                      414568963
     notificationtype               TRAP
   VARBINDS:
     iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0            type=67 value=Timeticks: (1166403) 3:14:24.03
     iso.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0        type=6  value=OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.0.1
     iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.2.1     type=2  value=INTEGER: 123456

The collector will produce this Tornado Event:

.. code:: json

   {
      "type":"snmptrapd",
      "created_ms":"1553765890000",
      "payload":{
         "protocol":"UDP",

         "src_port":"41543",
         "dest_ip":"127.0.2.2",
         "PDUInfo":{
            "version":"1",
            "errorstatus":"0",
            "community":"public",
            "receivedfrom":"UDP: [127.0.1.1]:41543->[127.0.2.2]:162",
            "transactionid":"1",
            "errorindex":"0",
            "messageid":"0",
            "requestid":"414568963",
            "notificationtype":"TRAP"
         },
         "oids":{
            "iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0":"67",
            "iso.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0":"6",
            "iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.2.1":"2"
         }
      }
   }

The structure of the generated Event is not configurable.

Testing
+++++++

To test the collector, verify that snmptrapd is installed on the machine
and follow the collector configuration instructions above.

As a prerequisite, the Tornado Engine should be up and running on the
same machine (:ref:`See the dedicated Tornado engine documentation
<tornado-engine-exec>`).

In addition the *snmptrap* tool is required to send fake snmptrapd
messages.

On Ubuntu, both the *snmptrap* tool and the *snmptrapd* daemon can be
installed with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install snmp snmptrapd

You can now start snmptrapd (as root) in a terminal:

.. code:: bash

   # snmptrapd -f -Le

And send fake messages with the command:

.. code:: bash

   $ snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.0.1 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.3.2.1 i 123456

If everything is configured correctly, you should see a message in the
snmptrapd standard error and an Event of type *'snmptrapd'* received by
the Tornado Engine.

In the event of authorization errors, and **only for testing purposes**,
you can fix them by adding this line to the *snmptrapd.conf* file (in
Ubuntu you can find it in */etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf*)::

   disableAuthorization yes

Extending MIBs
++++++++++++++

SNMP relies on MIB (Management Information Base) definition files, but
the *net-snmp* toolkit used in NetEye does not come with a complete set
for all network devices. You may thus find it necessary to add new
definitions when configuring Tornado in your environment.

If you have not previously set up *net-snmp* tools, you can enable the
principle command as follows:::

   yum install /usr/bin/snmptranslate

If your device is already in the system, this command will return its
OID, or else an error::

   # snmptranslate -IR -On snmpTrapOID
   .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1
   # snmptranslate -IR -On ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed
   Unknown object identifier: ciscoLS1010ChassisFanLed

If your device is not known, you can download its MIB file (e.g., from
`Cisco <ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/>`__) and place it in the
default NetEye directory::

   /usr/share/snmp/mibs

You will then need to make *net-snmp* aware of the new configuration and
ensure it is reloaded automatically on reboot. More information can be
found at the `official Net-SNMP
website <http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/TUT:Using_and_loading_MIBS>`__.
